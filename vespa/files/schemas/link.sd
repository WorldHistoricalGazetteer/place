# The Link model is designed to represent relationships between a Place and any other object, whether it is
# another Place, an event, a concept, or any other relevant entity. It allows for the specification of a wide
# range of predicates that describe the nature of the relationship. In addition to connections defined in the
# connection schema, any custom predicate can be used to capture various types of associations, such as
# "has_population" or "is_part_of". This schema also supports temporal validity, citation, confidence levels,
# and additional context about each link.

# The document namespace identifies the original source of the link, e.g. "pleiades", "geonames", "whg-dataset-123", "whg-user-456".
