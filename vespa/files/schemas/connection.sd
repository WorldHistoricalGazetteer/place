# The Connection model defines specific relationship types between places, captured as predicates that can be
# used in the link schema to specify how two places (or other objects) are related. Each connection has a
# label that provides a human-readable description of the relationship, a URI for the connection type
# (preferably from a recognised authority), and metadata describing the nature of the relationship, such
# as whether it is symmetric or has an inverse relationship. This schema provides a structured way to
# formalise connection types for use across the platform.
