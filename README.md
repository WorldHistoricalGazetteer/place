# World Historical Gazetteer: PLACE

### This is the repository for the **WHG PLACE** (Placement+Path+Period Linkage, Alignment, and Concordance Engine).

It contains the Kubernetes server configuration files for deploying and managing the World Historical Gazetteer (WHG)
application. This repository is separate from the main Django application
code ([here](https://github.com/WorldHistoricalGazetteer/whg3)), and provides a dedicated space for
configuring and orchestrating the server environment.

**Full documentation can be found at [docs.whgazetteer.org](https://docs.whgazetteer.org/content/500-System.html).**
