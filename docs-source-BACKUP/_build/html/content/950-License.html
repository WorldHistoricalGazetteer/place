<h3>Section 2 – Scope.<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2-scope" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>a. <strong>License grant.</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p>
<p>A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and</p>
<p>B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Exceptions and Limitations.</strong> For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this
Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Term.</strong> The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.</strong> The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights
in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do
so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this
Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Downstream recipients.</strong></p>
<p>A. <strong>Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.</strong> Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives
an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<p>B. <strong>No downstream restrictions.</strong> You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No endorsement.</strong> Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply
that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>b. <strong>Other rights.</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy,
and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
Rights, but not otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including
when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.</p></li>

Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and</p>
<p>c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License

<h3>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<a class="headerlink" href="#section-5-disclaimer-of-warranties-and-limitation-of-liability" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed
in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.</p>

limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if
the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</p>
<p>c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-6-term-and-termination">
<h3>Section 6 – Term and Termination.<a class="headerlink" href="#section-6-term-and-termination" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to
comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.</p>
<p>b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
violation; or</p></li>
<li><p>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p></li>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
violations of this Public License.</p>
<p>c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or
stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.</p>

or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.</p>

reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be

<p>c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly
agreed to by the Licensor.</p>
